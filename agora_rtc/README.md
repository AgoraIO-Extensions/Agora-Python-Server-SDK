# Change log

## 2024.12.09 Release 2.1.6
- New Features:
  -- Added AudioVadManager to manage VAD (Voice Activity Detection) instances.
  -- Integrated VAD functionality into the SDK. Developers no longer need to worry about how to use VAD; they only need to focus on setting appropriate parameters. Reference: sample_audio_vad.py
- Changes:
  -- In register_audio_frame_observer, two new parameters have been added to set the VAD parameters. Reference: sample_audio_vad.py
  -- In on_playback_audio_frame_before_mixing, two new return values have been added: vad_result_state and vad_result_bytearray.
    state:
    < 0: No internal automatic VAD applied
    0: No speaking
    1: Started speaking
    2: Speaking
    3: Stopped speaking
    vad_result_bytearray: The result processed by VAD, returned when VAD is active.
    If automatic VAD is enabled:
    Developers should use vad_result_bytearray for subsequent business processing (e.g., sending to ASR/STT), rather than using the raw frame data.
    Reference: sample_audio_vad.py
- Optimizations:
  -- Replaced the use of pacer with AudioConsumer for pushing PCM audio.
- Updates:
  -- Updated the samples related to Pacer and VAD.

## 2024.12.03 release Version 2.1.5
- Modifications:
  - LocalUser/audioTrack:
    -- When the scenario is chorus, developers don't need to call setSendDelayInMs.
    -- When the scenario is chorus, developers don't need to set the audio scenario of the track to chorus.
    -- NOTE: This can reduce the difficulty for developers. In AI scenarios, developers only need to set the service to chorus.
- Additions:
  -- Added the VadDump class, which can assist in troubleshooting vad issues in the testing environment. However, it should not be enabled in the online env  ironment.
  -- Added the on_volume_indication callback.
  -- Added the on_remote_video_track_state_changed callback.
- Removals:
  -- Removed Vad V1 version, only retaining the V2 version. Refer to voice_detection.py and sample_audio_vad.py.
- Updates:
  -- Updated relevant samples: audioconsume, vad sample.

## 2024.11.12 release 2.1.4
- Modify the type of metadata in videoFrame from str to bytes type to be consistent with C++; thus, it can support byte streams.
- The internal encapsulation of ExteranlVideoFrame has been modified to support byte streams. Regarding the support for alpha encoding, a logical judgment has been made. If fill_alpha_buffer is 0, it will not be processed.
## 2024.11.11 release 2.1.3
- Added a new sample: example_jpeg_send.py which can push JPEG files or JPEG streams to a channel.
-
- Performance overhead, as noted in the example comments, can be summarized as follows:
- For a 1920x1080 JPEG file, the process from reading the file to converting it to an RGBA bytearray - takes approximately 11 milliseconds.


## 2024.11.07 release 2.1.2
- Updates `user_id` in the `AudioVolumeInfoInner and AudioVolumeInfo` structure to `str` type.
- Fixes the bug in `_on_audio_volume_indication` callback, where it could only handle one callback to speaker_number 
- Corrects the parameter type in `IRTCLocalUserObserver::on_audio_volume_indication` callback to `list` type.

## 2024.10.29 release 2.1.1

Add audio VAD interface of version 2 and corresponding example.

## 2024.10.24 release 2.1.0

Fixed some bug.


### Common Usage Q&A
## The relationship between service and process?
- A process can only have one service, and the service can only be initialized once.
- A service can only have one media_node_factory.
- A service can have multiple connections.
- Release media_node_factory.release() and service.release() when the process exits.
## If using Docker with one user per Docker, when the user starts Docker and logs out, how should Docker be released?
- In this case, create service/media_node_factory and connection when the process starts.
- Release service/media_node_factory and connection when the process exits, ensuring that...
## If Docker is used to support multiple users and Docker runs for a long time, what should be done?
- In this case, we recommend using the concept of a connection pool.
- Create service/media_node_factory and a connection pool (only new connections, without initialization) when the process starts.
- When a user logs in, get a connection from the connection pool, initialize it, execute con.connect() and set up callbacks, and then join the channel.
- Handle business operations.
- When a user logs out, execute con.disconnect() and release the audio/video tracks and observers associated with the connection, but do not call con.release(); then put the connection back into the connection pool.
- When the process exits, release the connection pool (release each con.release()), service/media_node_factory, and the connection pool (release each con.release()) to ensure resource release and optimal performance.

## Use of VAD
# Source code: voice_detection.py
# Sample code: example_audio_vad.py
# It is recommended to use VAD V2 version, and the class is: AudioVadV2; Reference: voice_detection.py.
# Use of VAD:
  1. Call _vad_instance.init(AudioVadConfigV2) to initialize the vad instance. Reference: voice_detection.py. Assume the instance is: _vad_instance
  2. In audio_frame_observer::on_playback_audio_frame_before_mixing(audio_frame):

  3. Call the process of the vad module: state, bytes = _vad_instance.process(audio_frame)
Judge the value of state according to the returned state, and do corresponding processing.

    A. If state is _vad_instance._vad_state_startspeaking, it indicates that the user is "starting to speak", and speech recognition (STT/ASR) operations can be started. Remember: be sure to pass the returned bytes to the recognition module instead of the original audio_frame, otherwise the recognition result will be incorrect.
    B. If state is _vad_instance._vad_state_stopspeaking, it indicates that the user is "stopping speaking", and speech recognition (STT/ASR) operations can be stopped. Remember: be sure to pass the returned bytes to the recognition module instead of the original audio_frame, otherwise the recognition result will be incorrect.
    C. If state is _vad_instance._vad_state_speaking, it indicates that the user is "speaking", and speech recognition (STT/ASR) operations can be continued. Remember: be sure to pass the returned bytes to the recognition module instead of the original audio_frame, otherwise the recognition result will be incorrect.
# Note: 
  If the vad module is used and it is expected to use the vad module for speech recognition (STT/ASR) and other operations, then be sure to pass the returned bytes to the recognition module instead of the original audio_frame, otherwise the recognition result will be incorrect.
# How to better troubleshoot VAD issues: It includes two aspects, configuration and debugging.
  1. Ensure that the initialization parameters of the vad module are correct. Reference: voice_detection.py.
  2. In state, bytes = on_playback_audio_frame_before_mixing(audio_frame):

    - A . Save the data of audio_frame to a local file, reference: example_audio_pcm_send.py. This is to record the original audio data. For example, it can be named: source_{time.time()*1000}.pcm
    - B.Save the result of each vad processing:

      - a When state == start_speaking: create a new binary file, for example, named: vad_{time.time()*1000}.pcm, and write bytes to the file.
      - b When state == speaking: write bytes to the file.
      - c When state == stop_speaking: write bytes to the file and close the file.
    Note: In this way, problems can be troubleshot based on the original audio file and the audio file processed by vad. This function can be disabled in the production environment.

## Interrupt Handling in AI Scenarios
# Definition of Interrupt
In human-machine dialogue, an interrupt refers to the situation where a user suddenly interrupts the robot's response, requesting the robot to stop its current response immediately and shift to answer the user's new question. This behavior is called an interrupt.

# Trigger Conditions for Interrupts
Interrupts can be defined in different ways depending on the product. There are generally two modes:

- Mode 1: Voice Activation Mode
When it detects that the user is speaking, the interrupt strategy is triggered. For example, when the system recognizes speech, it triggers the interrupt strategy to stop the robot's response.

- Mode 2: ASR Activation Mode
When the system detects that the user is speaking and receives a result from ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) or STT (Speech-to-Text), the interrupt strategy is triggered.

# Advantages of Different Interrupt Strategies
Voice Activation Interrupt

Advantages:
Reduces the user's wait time and the likelihood of interrupts, as the robot will stop its response immediately when the user starts speaking, eliminating the need for the user to wait for the robot to finish speaking.
Disadvantages:
Since this is voice-activated, it may be triggered by meaningless audio signals, depending on the accuracy of the VAD (Voice Activity Detection). For example, if someone is typing on the keyboard while the AI is speaking, it might trigger the interrupt incorrectly.
ASR Activation Interrupt

Advantages:
Reduces the probability of unnecessary interrupts because the interrupt strategy is triggered only after ASR or STT has recognized the user’s speech.
Disadvantages:
Since this is ASR/STT-triggered, it requires converting the audio signal into text, which introduces a delay before the interrupt can be processed.
- Recommended Mode
If the VAD can filter out non-speech signals and only triggers when human speech is detected, the Voice Activation Mode is recommended. This mode is also suitable when the delay in processing the interrupt is not a major concern.

If the interrupt delay is not sensitive, the ASR Activation Mode is recommended. This mode can filter out non-speech signals more effectively and reduce the probability of an unintended interrupt.

How to Implement Interrupts? What Actions Are Required?
In a human-machine dialogue system, conversations are typically structured in "rounds," where each round consists of a question from the user, followed by a response from the robot, and so on. For each round, we can assign a roundId, incrementing it with each new round. A round consists of the following stages:

VAD (Voice Activity Detection):
This marks the start of the dialogue, where the system detects the beginning and end of the user's speech. It then passes this information to the ASR for further processing.

ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):
This phase involves recognizing the user's speech and converting it into text, which is then passed to the LLM (Large Language Model).

LLM (Large Language Model):
This is the generation phase, where the LLM processes the recognized user input and generates a response.

TTS (Text-to-Speech):
In this phase, the LLM’s response is converted into an audio format.

RTC Streaming:
The generated audio is streamed via RTC (Real-Time Communication) to be played back to the user.

Therefore, an interrupt happens when, in the next round (roundId+1), either through Voice Activation (triggered by the VAD phase) or ASR Activation (triggered when ASR recognizes the user’s speech), the following actions must be performed:

Stop the LLM Generation in the current round (roundId).
Stop the TTS Synthesis in the current round (roundId).
Stop the RTC Streaming in the current round (roundId).
API Call References:
Call: AudioConsumer.clear()
Call: LocalAudioTrack.clear_sender_buffer()
Business Layer: Clear any remaining TTS-related data (if applicable)


## When to Pass LLM Results to TTS for Synthesis?
LLM (Large Language Model) results are returned asynchronously and in a streaming manner. When should the results from the LLM be passed to TTS (Text-to-Speech) for synthesis?

Two main factors need to be considered:

Ensure that the TTS synthesized speech is unambiguous:
The speech synthesized by TTS must be clear, complete, and continuous. For example, if the LLM returns the text: "中间的首都是北京吗？", and we pass it to TTS as:

"中",
"国首",
"是北",
"京吗？",
This would result in ambiguous synthesis because there are no spaces between certain words (e.g., between "中" and "国", "首" and "是", and "京" and "吗"). Proper segmentation must be ensured to avoid such ambiguities.
Minimize overall processing delay:
If the LLM results are passed to TTS only after the entire response is generated, the speech synthesis will be unambiguous and continuous. However, this approach introduces significant delay, which negatively affects the user experience.

Recommended Approach
To achieve a balance between clarity and minimal delay, the following steps should be followed:

Store the LLM results in a cache as they are received.
Perform a reverse scan of the cached data to find the most recent punctuation mark.
Truncate the data from the start to the most recent punctuation mark and pass it to TTS for synthesis.
Remove the truncated data from the cache. The remaining data should be moved to the beginning of the cache and continue waiting for additional data from the LLM.
